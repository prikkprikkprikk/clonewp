# clonewp
A bash script to clone a production WordPress install to a local development version.

The author is hosting websites on SiteGround and developing locally in [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) (VVV).

This script should work in other setups too, as long as you have ssh access to the live server. Some instructions below pertains to VVV, though.

## Usage

Clone the repository into the root of your local WordPress installation:

     $ cd /Users/username/vagrant_local/www/example_site/public_html
     $ git clone git@github.com:prikkprikkprikk/clonewp.git

Then edit the settings in clonewp.yml. The file is well commented and should be self-explanatory.

Lastly, ssh into the Vagrant box and execute the script.

     $ vagrant ssh
     $ cd /srv/www/example_site/public_html
     $ clonewp/clonewp

Have a sip of your favorite beverage while the script â€¦

* connects to your live server,
* exports the database into wp-content/uploads/db.sql,
* rsyncs wp-content into your local WordPress installation,
* deletes the remote export,
* gets the correct table prefix from the remote wp-config.php,
* imports the database,
* replaces live URLs with local URLs,
* flushes the cache, and finally
* deactivates any unneeded plugins listed in the config file.

Subsequent runs of the script will take much shorter time than the first one, due to rsync's syncing capabilities.
